# Appointment Booking System - Issue Fixes

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. **Step Progression Not Working**
**Problem**: Next button not advancing to step 2 after selecting session type and professional
**Fix**: 
- Fixed step validation logic
- Changed `setStep(step + 1)` to `setStep(prev => prev + 1)` for proper state updates
- Added proper error handling and validation

### 2. **Admin Profiles Not Loading**
**Problem**: No professionals showing up in Step 1
**Fix**:
- Added fallback admin data for testing
- Fixed Firebase query to handle cases where `isAvailableForBooking` flag doesn't exist
- Added better error handling

### 3. **Available Time Slots Not Loading**
**Problem**: No time slots showing in Step 2
**Fix**:
- Added fallback time slots for testing
- Improved error handling when no availability is set by admins

### 4. **Import Issues in Components**
**Problem**: Missing imports causing compilation errors
**Fix**:
- Fixed duplicate imports in `RemainingSection.tsx`
- Added proper React and other necessary imports

## Testing the System:

### For Students:
1. Go to Find Help page
2. Click "Book New Appointment" or "Book Appointment" on any professional card
3. **Step 1**: Select session type (Individual/Group) and choose a professional
4. **Step 2**: Select a date and time slot
5. **Step 3**: Add optional notes and phone number, then confirm

### For Admins:
1. Login as admin
2. Go to Admin Dashboard
3. Click "My Schedule" tab to set availability
4. Click "Appointments" tab to manage bookings

## Current Testing Mode:

The system now includes fallback data so it works even without Firebase setup:

### Fallback Professionals:
- Dr. Sarah Mitchell (Clinical Psychology)
- Dr. Michael Rodriguez (Psychiatry)

### Fallback Time Slots:
- 09:00-10:00
- 10:00-11:00 
- 14:00-15:00

## Verification Steps:

1. **Open appointment booking modal**
2. **Select "Individual" session type** - should highlight the button
3. **Click on a professional** - should highlight the selection
4. **Click "Next"** - should advance to Step 2 (date/time selection)
5. **Select a future date** - time slots should appear
6. **Select a time slot** - should highlight the selection
7. **Click "Next"** - should advance to Step 3 (confirmation)
8. **Click "Book Appointment"** - should submit and show success message

## Error States Handled:

- No session type selected
- No professional selected
- No date selected
- No time slot selected
- Booking submission failures
- Network connectivity issues

## Component Structure:

```
AppointmentBooking.tsx
├── Step 1: Session Type & Professional Selection
├── Step 2: Date & Time Selection
└── Step 3: Confirmation & Additional Details
```

The system should now work properly for testing and will integrate with real Firebase data once admin availability is set up.
